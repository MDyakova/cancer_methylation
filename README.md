# PySpark notebooks for Large-Scale Leukemia Methylation Data Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a scalable and efficient solution for processing large datasets related to leukemia research using PySpark. Designed to handle the complexities of big data, the tool focuses on reducing, transforming, and filtering leukemia datasets for downstream analysis and research applications.

## Key Features

- **Data Reduction**: Efficiently reduces dataset size by aggregating and summarizing relevant information without losing critical insights.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies complex transformations to structure the data into a format suitable for machine learning models or statistical analysis.
- **Data Filtering**: Implements robust filtering techniques to isolate relevant records based on biological, clinical, or experimental conditions.
- **Scalability**: Built on Apache Spark, this tool can process datasets of any size by leveraging distributed computing.
- **Flexibility**: Easily customizable to incorporate new filters, transformations, or aggregation logic based on specific research requirements.

## Use Cases

- **Leukemia Biomarker Discovery**: Process raw genomic or proteomic data to identify potential biomarkers.
- **Patient Stratification**: Transform and filter patient datasets for targeted analyses.
- **Clinical Research**: Simplify and organize large-scale clinical data for statistical evaluations and trials.
- **Data Exploration**: Enable researchers to query and analyze specific subsets of leukemia datasets efficiently.

## How It Works

1. **Load Data**: Ingest large-scale leukemia datasets from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or data lakes.
2. **Data Reduction**: Summarize and condense the data by aggregating key metrics (e.g., average expression levels, counts).
3. **Data Transformation**: Apply schema transformations, join multiple datasets, or compute derived metrics for advanced analysis.
4. **Data Filtering**: Use predefined or custom filters to isolate subsets of the data based on user-specified criteria.
5. **Save Results**: Write the processed data back to storage in a desired format (e.g., Parquet, CSV).

## Advantages of Using PySpark

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Leverages Spark's in-memory computing capabilities for rapid data processing.
- **Distributed Computing**: Handles massive datasets by distributing workloads across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Interoperability**: Easily integrates with existing tools, workflows, and data storage systems.
- **Extensibility**: Supports the addition of new processing steps with minimal code changes.

## Requirements

- Apache Spark and PySpark installed on your system or cluster
- A large dataset related to leukemia research (e.g., genomic, proteomic, clinical data)
- A supported storage system (HDFS, S3, local disk, etc.)
